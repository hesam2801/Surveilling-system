# Real-Time Surveillance System Automation
This Python application demonstrates how to automate a real-time surveillance system efficiently. Using a multi-threaded architecture, the system continuously monitors a target website, detects changes (like newly added content), and performs automated actions, such as downloading related resources (e.g., images).

Designed for users seeking to build or understand surveillance automation systems, this project provides a practical and adaptable framework for monitoring and automating tasks in real time. It leverages powerful Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, threading, and os for robust performance and simplicity.
## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the surveillance system:
- Step 1: Clone the repository: \
` git clone https://github.com/hesam2801/Surveilling-system.git`
- Step 2: Switch to command mode in the terminal, run the following command in the terminal: \
`cmd`
- Step 3: Create a virtual environment folder (.venv) to install the required packages from the req.txt file. To set up the virtual environment, run the following command in the terminal: \
`python -m venv .venv`
- Step 4: Now, activate the virtual environment (.venv) to install the packages from the req.txt file within the virtual environment, run the following command in the terminal:
this code is for windows: \
`.\.venv\Scripts\activate` \
this code is for mac: \
`source ./.venv/bin/activate`
- Step 5: After activating the virtual environment (.venv), proceed to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, run the following command in the terminal: \
`pip install -r req.txt`
